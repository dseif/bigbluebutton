Exclude hidden or inactive elements
Elementsthatarehiddenbehindotherelements,providedonlyfordecoration,orlocatedoff-screenshouldbe
excluded from the reading order while they are invisible or inactive. Any active elements that can still be seen
by sighted users should remain in the reading order, even if they are read-only (not editable) or disabled.
Hidden elements include rollover content that has not been activated and elements that are hidden behind
modalpop-upwindows.Inaddition,inactivedecorativeelementsthatdonotconveyinformationshouldnot
be included in the reading order.
Setting the accessibilityEnabled property to false on a form, grouping, or container component will
disable accessibility for all child components; for example:
// turn accessibility support off for this form when it is hidden behind a modal pop-up
frmSignInForm.accessibilityEnabled = false;
When the property is set on an individual component, the setting affects the accessibility of just that particular
component. When accessibility is disabled for a component, it will not be exposed to assistive technology via
MSAA.
Provide controls for disruptive elements
Screen readers may interpret any automatically updating content on the screen as a change that must be
reported to the user. This can cause the screen reader to start over at the top of the page every time there is a
changeonthescreen.Examplesofelementsthatcanbedisruptivetoscreenreaderuserswhenaccessibilityis

announcing the information repeatedly. This approach makes any dynamic content inaccessible to screen
reader users, and does nothing for other users who may simply want to stop, pause, or hide the dynamic
content. See "Controlling dynamic and automatically updating content" on page 14 for guidelines on
handling such content.
Avoid redundant elements
When screen reader software encounters a Flex component, such as a form field, it announces the
component's accessible name. Screen reader users do not require visual labels for form fields that have an
accessible name property, but other users do need the visual label. A problem arises for screen reader users

ComboBox, List, DataGrid, and TextArea components. To avoid this redundancy, it is best to hide the visual
label for such components from the screen reader by setting the accessibilityEnabled property to false;
for example:
lblFirstName.accessibilityEnabled = false;
