Controlling dynamic and automatically updating content
Developers must provide user controls for any content that automatically updates for a period longer than five
seconds.Further,theusercontrolsmustbekeyboardaccessible;see"Keyboardaccessibility"onpage15for
more information.
Decorative and non-essential dynamic content
Decorative and non-essential dynamic content must be accompanied by a control to stop or hide it; for
example:
btnStop.accessibilityName = "Stop automatic decorative content changes";
btnSop.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, stopContentUpdates);
function stopContentUpdates(): void
{
// stop content updates not shown
// update skin of stop button
btnStop.accessibilityName = "Display automatic decorative content changes";
}
Automatically advancing sequential content
For news feeds, instructions, and other content that automatically sequences from one item to another,
developers should provide controls to pause and step through the content. These controls typically include
buttonsforPause/Play,Next,andPreviousoperations.WhenthePausebuttonisactivated,itshouldchangeto
a Play button; for example:
// set the accessible names of the story number, icon buttons for pause, next, and previous
// News story panel not shown
txtStoryNumber.text = "Story 2 of 5";
btnPlayPause.accessibilityName = "Pause";
btnNext.accessibilityName = "Next Story";
btnPrevious.accessibilityName = "Previous Story";
btnPlayPause.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, playPause);
function playPause(e:MouseEvent): void
{
// set accessible name based on the hypothetical Boolean playing
if (playing) // stop playing and change the pause button to play
btnPlayPause.accessibilityName = "Play";
else // play and change the play button to pause
btnPlayPause.accessibilityName = "Pause";
// change skin of button not shown
// advanced news story not shown
}

skipped, then it should resume at the point at which it was paused by the user. For example, if a user pauses a
series of printer connection instructions at step three, then the content should resume at that same step.
Dynamic real-time content
Real-time content that updates automatically, such as stock tickers, scoreboards, and clocks, creates a unique
set of challenges for users with disabilities. Frequent updates can disrupt screen readers and distract users with
