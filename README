Popcorn Maker working with Big Blue Button

To get working on your own machine do the following:

* Setup a BBB server as you normally would, setting the ip and what not
* `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* switch out 'YOUR_IP_HERE' with your ip in `./s.sh` and run it (this is to update the various urls in the repo, sorry about this step)
* install all node dependecies for butter, take a look at the butter readme for this
* `node make css`
* `node make server`
Enjoy!
