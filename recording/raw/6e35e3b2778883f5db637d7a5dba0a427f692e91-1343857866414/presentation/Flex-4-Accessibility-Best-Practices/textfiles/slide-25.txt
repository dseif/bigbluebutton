More complex layouts, like the one used in the application in Figure 3, are more likely to cause issues for
screen reader users. The application uses a repeater to populate a grid. There are three rows of products, and
each product has an image and a label indicating the cost of the product. Since the labels and images are in
separate components, they may not necessarily be read one after the other in a predictable order when the
