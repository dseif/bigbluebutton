Using text equivalents
Ifanativeobjectcannotbeusedtoconveyhierarchicalinformation,atextequivalentforthehierarchyshould
beprovidedviatheaccessibilityNameproperty.Forbasichierarchies,adirectdescriptionofthehierarchyis
sufficient; for example:
// ActionScript
imgFoodPyramid.accessibilityName = "The original food pyramid consisted of
four levels each representing a food group. The large base group Breads and
Cereals appears at the bottom, followed by Fruits and Vegetables, Dairy and
Meat, and the smallest group at the top, Fats and Sweets";
// MXML
<mx:Image id="imgFoodPyramid" accessibilityName="The original food pyramid
consisted of four levels each representing a food group. The large base group
Breads and Cereals appears at the bottom, followed by Fruits and Vegetables,
Dairy and Meat, and the smallest group at the top, Fats and Sweets" />

HR
Recruitment
Christopher Sharp
Compensation and Other
David Avila
The equivalent text for this organization may be defined as follows:
imgTechSupportOrgChart.accessibilityName =
"Level 1 - Senior Management, Level 2 - Tim Springer,
Level 1 - Information Technology, Level 2 - Mary Smith,
Level 1 - Finance, Level 2 - Ted Robins,
Level 1 - HR, Level 2 - Recruitment, Level 3 - Christopher Sharp,
Level 2 - Compensation and Other, Level 3 - David Avila";
Providing text equivalents for progress bars
Accessible applications must provide a text equivalent for any progress bars that convey important
information. An equivalent may not be required for an initial preloader progress bar if loading completes
within five seconds, though it is required for all other uses. The Flex 4 ProgressBar control does not provide
accessibility support automatically. To provide alternative text for these controls, developers should indicate
