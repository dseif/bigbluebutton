Enable accessibility using the command-line compiler
When compiling a file using the mxmlc command-line compiler, it is possible to explicitly override the setting
in the framework-config.xml file. To enable accessibility via the command-line compiler, use the
compiler.accessible command line flag (or just ­accessible), as shown in the following example:
c:>c:\flex _ 4 _ sdk\bin\mxmlc.exe ­compiler.accessible myApp.mxml
EmbeddingaccessibleFlexapplications
When a Flex application is to be deployed on the web, developers need to properly embed the Flex content
into an HTML page to ensure that it interacts in an accessible fashion with the host web page.
Note: The default HTML file created by Flash Builder 4 embeds Flex applications properly in the generated
HTML. Developers who use the standard embedding code do not need to modify application elements to
ensure that they are accessible.
Developers who do not use the standard embedding code must set the Window Mode (wmode) parameter of
the OBJECT element that is used to embed the SWF content in the HTML page to window. (This can also be
accomplished by ensuring the wmode parameter is not set; in this case Flash Player will use window as the
default value.) To set this value using a PARAM element as a child of the embedding OBJECT element, use the
following syntax:
<PARAM NAME="wmode" VALUE="window">
Transparent applications that allow the web page to show through SWF content, and opaque applications that
obscure but allow the SWF content to be on top of the page, are not accessible by assistive technologies
becausethereisnodefinedchildwindowcreatedbyFlashPlayerinsideofthebrowser.Iftheapplicationbeing
developed does not allow for the window mode to be set to window--because items must be displayed in
front of or behind the SWF content--developers may provide an alternative page that inserts that content
using the wmode='window' parameter.
