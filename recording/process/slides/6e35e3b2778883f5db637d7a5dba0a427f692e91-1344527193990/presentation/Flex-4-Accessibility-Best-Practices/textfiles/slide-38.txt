Time-limited forms and controls
For timed interactions, developers should ensure that forms do not disappear or expire if a response is not
received within a specified amount of time. Users with disabilities, who may be unable to complete the form
within a predetermined time, need a mechanism to indicate that they require more time. For time-limited tests
and similar applications, this guideline may be disregarded because removing the time limit would invalidate
thepurposeoftheactivity.Inthesescenarios,developersshouldmaketheuserawareofthetime-based
constraint and provide contact information for users that may need to seek exceptions to the time constraints
imposed by the activity.
Ontime-limitedforms,developersshouldwarntheuserwhenthetimelimitisabouttoexpireandallowthe
user to extend or eliminate the time limit. When prompted that time is about to expire, the user must be given
atleast20secondstoextendthetimelimitwithasimpleaction,suchaspressingthespacebar.Iftheuser
indicates that additional time is needed, setTimeout() can be used to add time to a timeout counter; for
example:
var timeoutID: uint;
var timeoutAlertID: uint;
...
timeoutID = setTimeout(timeIsAboutToExpire, 3600000);
...
function alertHandler(e: CloseEvent): void
{
if (alert.YES)
{
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
timeoutID = setTimeout(timeIsAboutToExpire, 3600000); // set new timeout
}
else
closeForm();
}
function timeIsAboutToExpire(): void
{
// display alert
timeoutAlertID = setTimeout(closeForm, 20000);
Alert.yesLabel = "Magenta";
Alert.noLabel = "Blue";
alert = Alert.show("Your Session is about to Expire.",Alert.YES|Alert.NO, alertHandler);
}
...
function closeForm(): void
{
// close the form time has expired
// close the timeout alert if it has not been closed
// display an alert telling the user that the session had expired
alert = Alert.show("Your Session Has Ended.");
...
}
