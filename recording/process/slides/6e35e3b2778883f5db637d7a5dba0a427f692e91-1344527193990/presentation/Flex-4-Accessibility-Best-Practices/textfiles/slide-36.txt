Error messages
After the form is submitted, any error messages should be provided in keyboard-focusable text at the
beginningoftheform'staborder.Errortextprovidedelsewheremaynotbeimmediatelyapparenttousersof

automatically to the overview error message positioned at the top of the form. This is an exception to the
general best practice of not moving keyboard focus automatically, described in "Focus" on page 39. This
approach immediately informs users of screen readers and screen magnifiers that form errors exist, so they will
not assume the form has been successfully submitted. Use setFocus() to set the focus to the error text; for
example:
btnSubmit.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, validateForm);
function validateForm(e: MouseEvent): void
{
var errorText = new Label();
// positioning of label not shown
addChild(errorText);
errorText.tabIndex = 10;
errorText.text = "Error: Please provide your last name.";
errorText.setFocus(); // set focus to the error text

provide at least one of three methods for avoiding and mitigating these errors: allow the submission to be
reversible, allow the user to confirm the data entered, or check the data for errors before completing the
submission.
Field specific errors
When field-specific error information is provided, the text should include any known suggestions on how to
correct the form if providing a suggestion would not invalidate the purpose of the field. The suggestion text
may include specific examples or the format of information that is required. These directions should be
