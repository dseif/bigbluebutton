flash.accessibilityAPI(http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/
accessibility/package-detail.html).
The primary mechanism for defining and updating accessibility information for user interface objects is the
AccessibilityProperties class, which exports basic accessibility information from Flex interface elements to
assistive technologies.
Name and description
Two key properties set via an AccessibilityProperties object are name and description:
· name -- The accessible name property in Flex allows assistive technology to identify user interface elements.
The name is the core identifying text for an element and is often set to be the label text placed near or on the
element or alternative text for a visual element such as an image. Note: The value assigned to this
AccessibilityProperties.name property is not the same as that assigned to an element's name property,
which provides a programmatic name for the element. The AccessibilityProperties.name value should
be a human readable, descriptive name. An accessible name should be concise and provide all required
information for the user to identify the component. Role, state, and value information, such as the type of
component(button,checkbox,andsoon),shouldnotbeincludedintheaccessiblename.Thisinformationis
exposed through the accessibility implementation associated with the component in the accessible role,
state, or value methods.
· description -- The accessible description property (set using accessibilityProperties.description)
provides supplementary detail of the component via a long form description of its use and purpose. This
property is a good place to put information such as special instructions on how to interact with the
component or an extended description that may be useful in understanding the component.
The accessible name and description fields can be accessed directly in ActionScript via the object.
accessibleProperties.name and object.accessibleProperties.description properties. Flex 3.5 and
later, however, provides convenience accessor methods for accessible MX and Spark objects directly through
these properties:
mx.core.UIComponent.accessibilityName (http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/
actionscript/3/mx/core/UIComponent.html#accessibilityName)
mx.core.UIComponent.accessibilityDescription (http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/
reference/actionscript/3/mx/core/UIComponent.html#accessibilityDescription)
Inthisdocument,theseaccessormethodsareusedwheneverpossibleforsimplicity.Ifan
accessibilityProperties object does not exist for a component that supports it, then one will

methods automatically invokes the Accessibility.updateProperties() method, which then informs
assistive technology to refresh any cached MSAA information. Thus, developers do not need to call
Accessibility.updateProperties() when using these accessors.
