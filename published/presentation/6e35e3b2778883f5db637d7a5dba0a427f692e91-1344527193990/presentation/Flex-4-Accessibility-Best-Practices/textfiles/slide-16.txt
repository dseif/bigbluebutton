16Adobe Flex White Paper
Note: While tab order and reading order are not interchangeable terms, in Flex they are both controlled
through the tabIndex attribute of an element. Reading order is independent of a component's tabEnabled
state. See "Reading order" on page 23 for more details.
Ifataborderisnotspecified,adefaulttaborderbasedonthehorizontalandverticalcoordinatesofeach
component will be used. Depending on the application and the layout of components on the screen, this
defaulttabordermaynotbelogical.ExplicitlysettingthetabIndex attribute of each component will ensure a
logical tab order.
Tab, Space, Enter, and arrow keys
InFlexapplications,theTab,Shift+Tab,Space,Enter,andarrowkeysaretheprimarykeysusedtonavigateto

following list describes these primary keystrokes:

There is no need to create event listeners to implement these key presses in Flex. The standard Flex event
handlerformouseclicksisalsotriggeredbypressingSpace(andEnterifthedefaultButton property is set).
Standard Flex components also handle Tab, Shift+Tab, and arrow keys appropriately. Developers should ensure
that the tabEnabled property is set on all actionable items that are to be included in the tab order. For
standard components, this is handled automatically. For custom components, an event handler is required to
process mouse clicks and relevant key presses; for example:
// the Mouse Click event will also monitor for the space bar to be pressed
and will be triggered by enter as well if a defaultButton has been set in the container
btnSearch.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, performSearch);
function performSearch(e:MouseEvent): void
{
// search not shown
}
