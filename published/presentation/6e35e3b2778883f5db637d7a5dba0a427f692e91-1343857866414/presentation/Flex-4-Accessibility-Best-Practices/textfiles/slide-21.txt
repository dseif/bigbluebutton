includes an event listener that moves the crop area when specific keys are pressed. The Control+Shift+arrow
keys control the crop rectangle's location.
imageCropArea.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY _ DOWN, adjustCrop);
function adjustCrop(e:KeyboardEvent): void
{
// check to ensure shift and control are pressed
if (!e.ctrlKey || !e.shiftKey)
return;
switch (e.keyCode)
{
case 37: // left arrow
{
// move crop area left
}
case 38: // up arrow
{
// move crop area up
}
case 39: // right arrow
{
// move crop area right
}
case 40: // down arrow
{
// move crop area down
}
}
Keyboard access to scrolling content and fields

thatcontainactionableelements.Ifactiveelementsmustbeusedwithinscrollingareas,see"CreatingTab
OrderandReadingOrder"(http://goo.gl/nwLJv) in the Flex 4 documentation for an example that shows how to
scroll to a component when tabbing. Screen readers may not detect components that were previously out of
view fast enough when they are brought into view. See "Sending events" on page 43 for details on how to
use the sendEvent() method of the Accessibility class to notify the screen reader software that a new
component has received focus.
When lengthy non-actionable text (such as license text) is placed in a field, the field must be scrollable via the
keyboard so keyboard-only users can review it. By default, some components provide keyboard access via the
up arrow, down arrow, page up, and page down keys. Developers should verify this functionality for the
component, and, if it is not provided by default, implement another keyboard-accessible scrolling mechanism.
