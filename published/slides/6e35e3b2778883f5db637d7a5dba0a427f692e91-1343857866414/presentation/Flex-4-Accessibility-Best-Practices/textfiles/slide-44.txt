properties. Thus, developers should be careful to fire events only when the underlying data reflects that such a
change has occurred.
Manually setting focus
The same methods and properties used to set focus manually are often used by code that forcibly shifts focus.
However, the events that trigger each of these scenarios are generally different. For example, mouse click
events(includingwhenEnterorSpaceispressedonthekeyboard)andkeyboardeventslisteningforshortcut
keys are typically used to set focus manually. The primary difference is that the former events are expected by
the user to shift focus while the later events are not expected to shift focus. When a focus shift occurs without
being linked to an expected action, it may prevent access to all content in a field or form.
// assign the Mouse click event handler (also triggered by assistive
technology and the space key) to the submit button
// when the address form is completed, a hypothetical credit card entry form is displayed
// focus is set to the first field in that screen, the credit card holder name field
btnSubmit.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, submitForm);
function submitForm(e:MouseEvent): void
{
// submit the form (not shown)
// when the next form appears, set focus to the first text input
txtCreditCardHolderName.setFocus();
}
Color
The colors that are used in Flex applications affect accessibility for users that are blind or have low vision as
well as for users with a color deficiency such as color blindness. Color-related accessibility guidelines focus on
two requirements: avoiding the use of color as the sole means of providing information and ensuring sufficient
contrast.
Conveying information with color
Color can be an effective way to draw a user's attention to important information, however, when color alone

accessible applications, developers must not use color as the only means of communicating any information.
Common situations were color is used alone to convey meaning include:

This requirement is not intended to discourage the use of color. Rather, the goal is to provide additional,
alternative methods of conveying the same information whenever color is used. These alternative methods fall
into two categories: those available to users who do not have assistive technology and those available to users
of assistive technologies.
Providing alternatives to individuals who are not using assistive technology ensures the application is
accessible to users who are color blind. For these users, an on-screen alternative that is positioned close to the
color-coded material is sufficient. This alternative should appear automatically and not require the user to
