IfaRadioButtonGroupcomponentisnotpresent,Flexwillautomaticallygenerateoneaslongasthe
groupName property is set on each Spark RadioButton. For this grouping to occur properly, developers must
set the same value for the groupName property for each radio button in the group. Grouping radio buttons in
this way will ensure that users can use arrow keys to cycle through all radio buttons in a group.
Note: To ensure form fields are grouped properly, developers must also set a tab order that flows through the
form and any groups logically. Generally, proper tab order within a form follows the implied visual tab order or
business logic of the form. The implied visual tab order is the order in which users would expect tab stops to
occur,giventhevisuallayoutoftheform.See"Keyboardaccessibility"onpage15and"Readingorder"on
page 23 for more details.
The number of radio buttons in a group is not typically indicated automatically by assistive technology for Flex
applications. This is because the groupName property is not exposed through MSAA and assistive technologies
have no way to determine if a set of radio buttons is related (other than by their relative proximity in the
readingorder).Iftheusermustknowtheradiobuttoncountproperlyusetheform,thenitshouldbeappended
