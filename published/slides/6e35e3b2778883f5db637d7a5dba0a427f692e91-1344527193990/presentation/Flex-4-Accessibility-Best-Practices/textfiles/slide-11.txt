each bar, pie slice, or line on a graph. When an alternative data table or DataGrid component cannot be used to
present this information, it can be provided in text format instead; for example:
// ActionScript
imgChart1.accessibilityName = "Q1, East, Units sold 2,000; Q1, South, Units Sold: 1,800;
Q1 North, Units sold: 1,700; Q1, West, Units Sold: 2,200";
// MXML
<mx:Image id="imgChart1" accessibilityName="Q1, East, Units sold 2,000;
Q1, South, Units Sold: 1,800; Q1 North, Units sold: 1,700;
Q1, West, Units Sold: 2,200" />
Notes on image equivalents and use
For buttons with images, describe the action the button triggers rather than the image itself. For example, for a
button with a printer icon, "print form" is a better text equivalent than "printer".
Avoid using the terms "image" and "photograph" to describe the element unless it is essential. For any item
rendered, assistive technology will indicate the element type to the user, so including these terms in the
equivalent text is redundant. For example, when a screen reader encounters an image with "image of a red
ball"asalternativetext,itwillannounce"Image:Imageofaredball."Incontrast,whenthetextalternativeis
simply"Redball,"therenderinginassistivetechnologywillbethefarmoreconcise"Image:RedBall."
Consistency is important when images are used to invoke an action. For example, if an application uses a print
button with an image of a printer and the equivalent text "Print", then that same image and equivalent text
should be used for print buttons throughout the application.
Developers should not use the same image to represent more than one concept or function, nor should they
associate more than one image for the same function.

equivalent. As described above, however, set the accessibilityEnabled property to false or set the
silent property of the AccessibilityProperties object to true to hide such images from assistive
technologies.
Text that conveys additional information through font, size, or color
Content that conveys meaning through size, shape, location, or color must be accompanied by a textual
equivalentforthatinformation.Inpractice,thisgenerallyariseswhentextstylingisusedtoconvey
information. For example, a text cloud showing frequency of word use through font size requires a text
equivalent, such as an HTML table or HTML ordered list that provides the same data. The preferred method of
providingthisinformationinaFlexapplicationviatheaccessiblenameonthetextcloudImage:
//ActionScript
imgCloud.accessibilityName = "Favorite Shaved Ice Flavors in Descending order:
1. Grape, 2. Orange, 3. Lime";
// MXML
<mx:Image id="imgCloud" accessibilityName="Favorite Shaved Ice Flavors
in Descending order: 1. Grape, 2. Orange, 3. Lime" />
Likewise, when text color is used to convey information, provide a text equivalent or rewrite the text. See
"Color" on page 44 for more information. For error text that uses a color such as red, the text "error" can be
added to the label of the error text field; for example:
//ActionScript
txtError.text = "Error: An incorrect search term was entered.";
// MXML
<s:Text id="txtError" text="Error: An incorrect search term was entered." />
Adding the word "error" to the text itself instead of just to the accessible name is preferred because the
accessible name property is not apparent to users with color blindness or other visual impairments who are
